Here’s the flow written in a proper **README.md** format for your repository:

# Node.js Web Application with CI/CD Pipeline

This repository contains a basic Node.js web application integrated with a CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline automates the process of testing, building, and deploying the application using GitHub Actions and Docker.

---

## Features

- Automated testing with Jest and Supertest.
- Dockerized application for easy deployment.
- CI/CD pipeline triggered on every push to the `main` branch.
- Docker image pushed to Docker Hub for seamless deployments.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline Flow

### **1. Code Push**
- Developers commit and push code changes to the `main` branch.
- This action triggers the CI/CD pipeline workflow.

---

### **2. CI/CD Pipeline Overview**

The pipeline, defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`, runs the following steps:

1. **Checkout Code:**
   - Pulls the latest code from the repository.

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Sets up Node.js (version 16) to run the application.

3. **Dependency Installation:**
   - Installs dependencies from `package.json` using:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Unit Testing:**
   - Runs tests using Jest to verify the application’s functionality.
     ```bash
     npm test
     ```

5. **Docker Build:**
   - Builds a Docker image of the application.
     ```bash
     docker build -t <username>/nodejs-web-app:latest .
     ```

6. **Docker Authentication:**
   - Logs in to Docker Hub using credentials stored as GitHub secrets.

7. **Docker Push:**
   - Pushes the built Docker image to Docker Hub for deployment.
     ```bash
     docker push <username>/nodejs-web-app:latest
     ```

---

### **3. Deployment**

Once the Docker image is successfully pushed to Docker Hub, it can be deployed using:
```bash
docker pull <username>/nodejs-web-app:latest
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 <username>/nodejs-web-app:latest
```
- The application will then be accessible at `http://<server-ip>:3000`.

## Benefits of This Setup

- **Automated Testing:** Prevents bugs by ensuring each code change is verified.
- **Simplified Deployment:** Containerization with Docker makes deployments consistent and portable.
- **Continuous Integration:** Ensures the app is always in a deployable state.
